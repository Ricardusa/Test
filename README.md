Recipe Website Project
This project is all about building a basic recipe website to practice your HTML skills. The idea is to create a simple website that showcases your favorite recipes. You can choose any recipes you like, and for each recipe, you'll create a dedicated HTML page.

Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to:

Apply your HTML knowledge by creating individual HTML pages for various recipes.
Display the recipe title, ingredients, cooking instructions, and optionally, images of the prepared dish.
